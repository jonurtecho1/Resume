## Document Structure Decisions

### Format Guidelines
1. **Removed "Projects" section** - Not needed for work experience documentation
2. **Word wrapping** at ~75-80 characters for readability
3. **Consistent structure** across all jobs:
   - Job Title, Company, Location, Start/End Dates
   - Responsibilities
   - Achievements
   - Techniques/Methods (for technical roles)
   - Technologies/Tools

### Writing Style
- Use powerful action verbs (Conducted, Led, Drove, Established, Architected, etc.)
- Focus on quantifiable results where possible
- Highlight technical depth and breadth
- Emphasize leadership, innovation, and impact
- Include both responsibilities (what you did) and achievements (impact/results)

## Session Notes

### Session 1: October 31, 2025
- Created work_experience_notes.txt structure
- Documented JOB 1 (Manufacturing Operator, 1998)
- Documented JOB 2 (Package FIFA Technician, 1999-2003)
- Moved Projects section (decided to remove)
- Moved last 2 responsibilities from JOB 1 to Achievements
- Refined language for professional tone
- Created comprehensive acronyms section
- Learned: When asked to "save" or "update file", user expects direct file modification (which Copilot cannot do - requires manual copy/paste or user-initiated save)
- Created copilot.md as knowledge base for future sessions

---

## File Structure

```
Resume/
├── work_experience_notes.txt  (Main work experience documentation)
├── copilot.md                 (This file - knowledge base)
└── [Future files to be added]
```

---

## Important Notes for Future Sessions

1. **File Updates**: Copilot cannot directly write to files. User must copy/paste code blocks or use VS Code's apply feature, or save manually.

2. **Git Operations**: Copilot cannot execute git commands. User must manually run git add, commit, push.

3. **Work Experience Flow**: 
   - Start with responsibilities (what you did day-to-day)
   - Then capture achievements (impact, results, innovations)
   - Finally list technologies/tools
   - For technical roles, add Techniques/Methods section

4. **Writing Quality**: Use strong action verbs, quantify results, emphasize leadership and technical depth.

5. **User Workflow Preference**: When user says "save" or "update", they want immediate file changes. Always provide complete copy/paste-ready content in code blocks.
