JOB 1:
------
Job Title: Manufacturing Operator
Company: Intel Corporation
Location: Costa Rica
Start Date: February 8, 1998
End Date: December 1998
Responsibilities:
- Test Operator: Tested Intel Pentium 2 SECC (Single Edge Contact Cartridge) processors using In Circuit Test (ICT) equipment
- Post Assembly Visual Inspector: Performed quality inspection of assembled Pentium 2 cartridges for defects and compliance with quality standards
- FI (Fault Isolation) and Rework: Conducted in-line fault isolation to identify and diagnose product defects based on ICT logs, then performed rework on repairable products including touch-ups, component replacement, and correcting solder defects (cold solders, insufficient solder, solder bridges, shorts, opens)
- Cross-functional Collaboration: Interacted with Quality FIFA (Fault Isolation and Failure Analysis) engineers to root cause sources of defects and low yield. Supported reject validations, root cause DOE (Design of Experiments) analysis, and implemented corrective actions in test operations by improving and implementing procedures
- Test Area Coordination: Volunteered to distribute operators across testers to maximize tester utilization and minimize downtime. Coordinated operator breaks, lunch times, vacations, sick leave, and no-shows. Scheduled preventive maintenance downtime for testers to ensure continuous production flow
- Training: Trained new operators on test operations, FI rework, and post visual inspection procedures
- Specialized BGA Rework: Selected as part of a reduced group of operators trained to rework BGA (Ball Grid Array) processing on SECC PCBs, requiring complex technical skills and precision craftsmanship
- Quality FIFA Subject Matter Expert: Became the go-to resource for Quality FIFA labs to support reworks and DOEs for root cause analysis
- Technical Equipment Expert: Developed deep knowledge of tester architecture beyond basic operation, providing technical feedback to module engineers on equipment malfunctions and insights about possible faults

Achievements:
- Identified failing ICT signatures and mapped them to specific components based on rework knowledge, created BKMs (Best Known Methods) to process those signatures faster by determining possible fault locations and narrowing down failures to specific components or regions on the SECC assembly
- Maintained tester utilization >90% (9 out of 10 testers operating at all times during 12-hour shifts) through effective operator scheduling and resource management
- Maximized throughput to 10 lots per tester per 12-hour shift by implementing efficient load/unload mechanisms to minimize idle times
- Proactively volunteered for off-shift test area equipment installation, certifications, equipment sign-off, and release to production (outside role requirements) to gain deeper understanding of tester systems

Projects:
