JOB 1:
------
Job Title: Manufacturing Operator
Company: Intel Corporation
Location: Costa Rica
Start Date: February 8, 1998
End Date: December 1998
Responsibilities:
- Test Operator: Tested Intel Pentium 2 SECC processors using ICT equipment
- Post Assembly Visual Inspector: Performed quality inspection of assembled 
  Pentium 2 cartridges for defects and compliance with quality standards
- FI and Rework: Conducted in-line fault isolation to identify and diagnose 
  product defects based on ICT logs, then performed rework on repairable 
  products including touch-ups, component replacement, and correcting solder 
  defects (cold solders, insufficient solder, solder bridges, shorts, opens)
- Cross-functional Collaboration: Interacted with Quality FIFA engineers to 
  root cause sources of defects and low yield. Supported reject validations, 
  root cause DOE analysis, and implemented corrective actions in test 
  operations by improving and implementing procedures
- Test Area Coordination: Volunteered to distribute operators across testers 
  to maximize tester utilization and minimize downtime. Coordinated operator 
  breaks, lunch times, vacations, sick leave, and no-shows. Scheduled 
  preventive maintenance downtime for testers to ensure continuous flow
- Training: Trained new operators on test operations, FI rework, and post 
  visual inspection procedures
- Specialized BGA Rework: Selected as part of a reduced group of operators 
  trained to rework BGA processing on SECC PCBs, requiring complex technical 
  skills and precision craftsmanship

Achievements:
- Identified failing ICT signatures and mapped them to specific components 
  based on rework knowledge, created BKMs to process those signatures faster 
  by determining possible fault locations and narrowing down failures to 
  specific components or regions on the SECC assembly
- Maintained tester utilization >90% (9 out of 10 testers operating at all 
  times during 12-hour shifts) through effective operator scheduling and 
  resource management
- Maximized throughput to 10 lots per tester per 12-hour shift by 
  implementing efficient load/unload mechanisms to minimize idle times
- Proactively volunteered for off-shift test area equipment installation, 
  certifications, equipment sign-off, and release to production (outside role 
  requirements) to gain deeper understanding of tester systems
- Became the go-to resource for Quality FIFA labs to support reworks and 
  DOEs for root cause analysis
- Developed deep knowledge of tester architecture beyond basic operation, 
  providing technical feedback to module engineers on equipment malfunctions 
  and insights about possible faults

Technologies/Tools:
- ICT equipment for Pentium 2 SECC processors
- ICT log analysis and interpretation
- Visual inspection tools and quality control systems
- Fault isolation diagnostic tools
- Soldering equipment and rework tools
- BGA rework equipment and techniques
- Component replacement tools
- DOE methodologies
- BKM documentation
- Production scheduling and workforce management
- Equipment installation and certification procedures
- Tester architecture and hardware troubleshooting


JOB 2:
------
Job Title: Package FIFA Technician
Company: Intel Corporation
Location: Costa Rica
Start Date: January 1999
End Date: December 2003
Responsibilities:
- Conducted comprehensive FIFA on Pentium 2 SECC products to resolve 
  production yield issues, quality monitor triggers, and stress readout 
  failures, leveraging advanced analytical instrumentation (ICT, X-RAY, 
  CSAM/TSAM, CNC, SEM/EDX, FTIR, TDR, Plasma Etchers, PMU, Pico/Micro 
  Probers) while performing destructive FA through cross-sectioning, 
  chemical/mechanical deprocessing, and conductive coating application for 
  SEM analysis
- Led Material Board Review and Yield Improvement Task Forces to identify 
  and resolve failure modes/mechanisms impacting production yield and product 
  quality through comprehensive FIFA analysis, DOEs, root cause investigations, 
  and systematic corrective action recommendations
- Drove Assembly and Product HVM site certifications for FIFA labs and 
  production processes, developing innovative matching criteria for emerging 
  assembly/test technologies beyond traditional MCM approaches
- Established FIFA lab infrastructure across multiple operations by managing 
  tool procurement, budget planning/allocation, equipment installation and 
  qualification, consumables management, and facility/equipment maintenance

Achievements:
- Successfully enabled CR Package FIFA labs to support next-generation OLGA 
  packages and managed ceramic/PCB package EOL transitions
- Architected and implemented robust FIFA tracking systems featuring database 
  backend and web-based user interfaces for streamlined job submission and 
  workflow management
- Recognized as global Package FIFA subject matter expert, integrating 
  critical task forces across worldwide Intel operations
- Orchestrated seamless Y2K lab infrastructure transition with zero downtime
- Pioneered package FIFA methodologies and techniques that remain standard 
  practice in Intel labs today
- Scaled lab operations as founding technician, expanding team 5x (from 2 to 
  10+ members) through comprehensive training, coaching, and mentoring programs
- Completed strategic 1-year Tour of Duty in Assembly/Test Technology 
  Development, evaluating and certifying innovative packaging technologies 
  including package reliability assessments, die underfill processes, and IHS 
  solutions for Pentium 3 product family
- Developed the first-ever Package FIFA ATE channel-to-package signal mapper 
  system, transitioning from inefficient text/Excel files to a web-based 
  interface with database backend for storing collaterals across different 
  tester configurations and loadboards, improving TPT while eliminating all 
  cases of wrong mappings
- Leveraged extensive package FIFA knowledge to extend support beyond product 
  into module equipment, loadboards, motherboards, sockets, burn-in boards, 
  embedded boards/systems, module mechanical failures, and operation failures
